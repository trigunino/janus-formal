## Highest-priority theorem queue

1. Construct the actual decorated mapping torus, throat embedding and normal-root/SpinC data.
2. Specify the exact Janus field space and metric formulation without double counting.
3. Build the concrete compatibility map `K`, its linearization `J` and the target pairing `H`.
4. Construct the adapted SpinC/PT/Z4/BRST jet symmetry and natural bundles.
5. Classify invariant pairings and smooth equivariant evaluators globally.
6. Derive the full Euler source and prove nonlinear Helmholtz/Noether conditions.
7. Compute variational cohomology, boundary terms and anomalies in one regulator.
8. Derive action normalization and finite counterterms microscopically.
9. Compute the full effective action and prove one scheme-independent stable vacuum.
10. Close bulk/throat/LL/bimetric charge units and the absolute scale.

## Update rule

Every new result must update:

- its program ID and evidence label;
- the canonical status file when it changes the frontier;
- the branch registry when it changes build support;
- the relevant focused CI target.

Do not use percentage-complete claims as substitutes for named theorems and blockers.
